## 🌟 What This Is

- **Franchisors (Admin)** to review applications, approve franchises, manage global inventory, and monitor system-wide sales activity.
- **Franchisees (Owners)** to apply for franchises, manage their specific branch, oversee local staff, and track branch performance.
- **Managers** to oversee day-to-day operations, approve staff requests, handle inventory restocks, and submit daily sales data.
- **Staff** to process daily transactions, check local stock levels, and submit inventory requests to their managers.
